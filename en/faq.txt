  <li><b>What is Notionary ?</b>
      <p>
      Notionary is a collection of short tests that help you learn any topic with Questions and Answers (e.g. European Capitals),
      or Images (e.g. African Flags), or Sounds (e.g. Famous Anthems), or a combination (e.g. Music Notation).

      <br/>Notionary uses the ideas behind Dr. Hermann Ebbinghaus' work on memory, learning, and forgetting.<br/>

      <br/> During testing, the system tracks the student's performance with a score and elapsed time for future
      gauging of the student's learning progress. Any mistakes are also recorded and made ready in future
      review of the material.

  <li><b>How can I create a Notion ?</b>
      <p>
      Notions can be created manually by writing the ( Question -->> Answer ) pairs in the simple Notion Editor provided by Notionary.<br/>
      Alternatively, Notions can be uploaded into the system as files with ( Question -->> Answer ) pairs separated by " -->> ".<br/>
      Simply use your favorite text editor to create a ".txt" or ".csv" file as shown below :<br/>
      <span class='broso'>Question 1</span> &nbsp;-->>&nbsp; <span class='bgrun'>Answer 1</span><br/>
      <span class='broso'>Question 2</span> &nbsp;-->>&nbsp; <span class='bgrun'>Answer 2</span><br/>
      <span class='broso'>Question 3</span> &nbsp;-->>&nbsp; <span class='bgrun'>Answer 3</span><br/>
      <span class='broso'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span> -->> <span class='bgrun'>...</span><br/>
      <span class='broso'>Question x</span> &nbsp;-->>&nbsp; <span class='bgrun'>Answer x</span><br/>
      After a Notion is created manually or uploaded, it is then possible to edit the Notion to add Images and
      Sounds to each Question. These Images and Sounds should help the student to make a connection to the
      Answer without necessarily giving the Answer away. If you feel that the material in a Notion is better
      learned through watching a video or reading a document, you can still use Notionary as a testing platform
      and link the ( YouTube ) video as well as attach the ( PDF ) document to the Notion as preliminary study material.
