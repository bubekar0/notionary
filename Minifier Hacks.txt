The minification process redefines (smaller) versions of all functions and most "id" and "class" elements
ignoring those whose length is less than 6 characters.
However, there are two known potential pitfalls

1) Naming a function the same as a class or id (or a substring of) will cause the CSS to be lost as it
   will then get reminified. Functions are minified first, then ids and then classes
   So if you have function foople() and class='foopleXXX'
   The function gets minified as nf_g67 for example via a sed substitution command
   which  is then applied together with similar substitutions for ids and classes thus
   turning class foople substring into class nf_g67 which then gets further minified into nc_XXX which of
   course does not correspond to any part of the CSS image
   Best practice is to name ids and classes of a module with the module name as prefix e.g.
   id='examPushButton' class='examRainbowColors' etc because it is guaranteed that no function within
   the exam module will be named examXXX().

2) Having the server marking up parts of the document it is imperative that none of ids or classes
   are used by the JavaScript code on the client. Simply because on the server no minifying takes place
   There is nothing to worry about as far as functions minifying goes. Also ids and classes are safe
   as long as they are shorter than 6 chars.
   But if you have for example class='notionary-burbuja' on the server markup while on the client you also
   make use of the class='notionary-burbuja'. It will be minified at the client only hence missing any
   CSS intended.

3) The ideal() obfuscator counts on all id= decalrations to be SINGLE QUOTED
   If you flip quotes so as to handle apostrophes in the included strings, it is imperative to define a variable to handle
   such situations outside the id line. See naryImage:markupImageUpload() "minifierBUG"

4) Grouping #id's or  .classes styling in the CSS files is dangerous if one of them gets extra CSS e.g.
   #foople, #goople { x1:y1; x2:y2; }  /* then on the next line */
   #goople { x3:y3; } /* Causes the minifier to ignore the above CSS of goople as this one is processed last */

In summary, don't collide functions with id/classes name-wise, and ensure any server markup is not reused at client
